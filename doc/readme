---------------

Music Barrel is packaged as .war and executable .jar file.
Web package can be deployed under any application server
as TJWS, Tomcat or any other servlet container. It doesn't require any pre/post
installation steps and can be dropped in an auto deploy directory
of an application server.
Jar package can be just executed and not requiring a separate
application server.
War deployment is preferred for a dedicated home theater machine,
because it can be started at a system boot time.
